Timesheet:
  27 Hours - 
  Formatted general sections with HTML and CSS; light JS was included.
  Added some CSS test cases for viewing Leaderboard and Gameplay
  Added comments in HTML for clarity
  Updated all instances of game to reference gameplay
  Added functionality to the "redirect-gameplay" and "redirect-leaderboard" buttons to send users to the appropriate "pages" using additional JS
  Separated JS into three sections with comments
  Added some JS in preparation for database calls.
  Put more time than I should have into reworking the page centering to not cut off gameplay
  Animated Start and Leaderboard buttons: Animated rest of forms
  Added the ability to toggle animations for performance, legacy use, and accessability
  Added Restart button that reloads the page from cache. I will do a proper reset once the game has an end function that I can use.
  Began work on the API calls of the database. Currently learning how to convert promises and responses from JSON into actionable data, since our API of choice has no other way of accessing consistent image URLs
