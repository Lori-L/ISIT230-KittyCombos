  13.5 hours -
  Created the Player and GameCanvas classes, as well as the game grid div. 
  A GameCanvas object has a populateBoard() method that will fill the game grid with tile divs. Each tile div is given an element ID for future reference, as well as a random image. As this data is sufficient for the purposes of our project, easily modifiable, and stored entirely within the HTML, the GameTile class is no longer necessary. 
  Tiles are currently moveable by clicking and dragging them. This is possible, but annoying to do on mobile devices. I will work on adding a method that can work by the user clicking (or tapping) on both tiles to be swapped.
  When tiles are swapped, a check is in place to ensure that the tiles are adjacent. I have not yet added a check to ensure that the swap will result in a match. This will be done next week.
  Matches of 3 will be detected and removed from the board by filling in a blank image. Next week, I will add methods to detect and remove matches of 4 and 5. I will also add a method that repopulates empty matched tiles, so the board does not empty as the player progresses through a game.
